Make sure to download Heklili Priority Helper from Curseforge or anything.
When ingame, go to /hekili and unbind all the shortcuts / keybinds from the toggle menu.
If you have issues with performance (for example: the rotation feels slow) either uncheck these marks here, or check them and play around with the settings. Settings for Rotation performance.
For example: Combat Refresh Interval and maximum update time can be set lower to achieve better results with the rotation. Make sure to check "Enhanced Recheck". Settings for Rotation performance (an example).
