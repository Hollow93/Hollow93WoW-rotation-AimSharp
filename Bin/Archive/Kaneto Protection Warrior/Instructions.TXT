Hey guys,
this is xKaneto from the A# Discord.

Thank you for using out my Prot Warrior Rotation.
When you are starting the rotation, the loader will show the following:

These macros can be used for manual control:
/xxxxx SaveCooldowns
Toggles the use of big cooldowns on/off.
/xxxxx AOE
Toggles AOE mode on/off.

Special Toggles for usage.
/xxxxx StormBolt 
Queues Storm Bolt up to be used on the next GCD.
/xxxxx RallyingCry
Queues Rallying Cry up to be used on the next GCD.
/xxxxx IntimidatingShout
Queues Intimidating Shout up to be used on the next GCD.
"/xxxxx Shockwave 
Queues Shockwave to be used on the next GCD.

Replace xxxxx with first 5 letters of your addon, lowercase.
Raid Talents: 3221211, M+ Talents: 3221233

This rotation is optimized for usage of Venthyr and Kyrian Covenants.
If you want others to be added, write a message in the Discord Feedback Channel with @xKaneto!

Otherwise two things to be noted:
Ravager and Spear of Bastion will be casted on your character.
If you want to change that: Search for "@player" in your Rotation.cs file and change it to @cursor

Feel free to ask me any questions and if you have feedback on the rotation, send me a message.

Best Regards
xKaneto
