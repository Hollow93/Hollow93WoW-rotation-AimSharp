You can add macro "/xxxxx wait #" which can be used to pause the bot for # seconds so you can use your own abilities without the bot interfering.
For example, you can use:

/xxxxx wait 2
/cast Fel Rush

on a Demon Hunter to pause the bot for 2 seconds, use Fel Rush, and then it will auto unpause after 2 seconds.
As always, xxxxx is the first 5 letters of your addon name in small letters.



Silent mode and extra keys.  -->> These settings can be used by advanced users.



Silent mode disables all raid warnings and chat notifications from the bot to make it safer for streaming

Extra keys disables keybinds 1-8 from the bot so you can use those for manual control.  To use these advanced settings, make a text file named Settings.txt in your AimsharpWow\bin directory and add these lines:

Silent=true
ExtraKeys=true


You can also switch to WoW Classic/TBC Classic or WoW Beta by using the advanced setting

WowBuild=classic

WowBuild=beta
